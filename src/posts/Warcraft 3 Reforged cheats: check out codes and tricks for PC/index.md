The Warcraft 3: reforged is a reworked version of the classic strategy game Blizzard , which brings improved graphics and other changes to the original game. A feature that was almost completely reused was the cheat list, which TechTudo has put together below.

It is possible to use the selection of Warcraft 3: Reforged tricks during single player matches. The title does not allow the player to use codes to gain advantage in multiplayer matches. The list includes some cheats present in the original version, released for PC in 2002, which were reused by Blizzard in the new edition.

To activate the cheat, press the Enter key during single player mode or on an offline map. Enter the code you want and press Enter again. A message confirming that the trick has been activated will be displayed shortly thereafter.
